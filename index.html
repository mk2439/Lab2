        <h3>Plant Disease Detection using CNN</h3>
        <p>Plant disease identification is the study based upon the fact of patterns. Plant diseases make production more difficult to  produce. To avoid losses in agricultural productivity and quantity, disease detection is used. Deep learning can help to avoid the  problems of manually choosing disease spot features, raise the accuracy of plant disease extracting features, and increase speed  scientific and innovation transition. We used images to train the data and perform the CNN algorithm. One of the most important factors in  the horticultural turn of events is the plant's ability to be maintained. It's exceedingly difficult to get the appropriate identifiable proof of plant illnesses.

    <h2>Addendum</h2>
    <p>
        The structural choices in this resume webpage were made to ensure clarity and accessibility of information. 
        The use of semantic HTML elements like <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, and 
        <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> was intentional to create a well-organized and easily understandable document structure.
    </p>
    <p>
        The decision to use a simple and clean style without much formatting is intentional at this stage. 
        The focus was on functionality, and aesthetics will be addressed in the next module when CSS is introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, the inclusion of a dynamic 'Last updated' timestamp using JavaScript provides transparency about the latest modifications to the content.
