        <h3>Plant Disease Detection using CNN</h3>
        <p>Plant disease identification is the study based upon the fact of patterns. Plant diseases make production more difficult to  produce. To avoid losses in agricultural productivity and quantity, disease detection is used. Deep learning can help to avoid the  problems of manually choosing disease spot features, raise the accuracy of plant disease extracting features, and increase speed  scientific and innovation transition. We used images to train the data and perform the CNN algorithm. One of the most important factors in  the horticultural turn of events is the plant's ability to be maintained. It's exceedingly difficult to get the appropriate identifiable proof of plant illnesses.

    <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>
            This resume webpage's architecture decisions were carefully considered to guarantee information accessibility and clarity. The user's experience was taken into consideration while choosing each HTML element, with the goal of creating a structured and user-friendly document.
        </p>
        <p>
            Semantic elements like as <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>Â emphasize inclusiveness and user-friendly design principles, making the text easier to read for assistive technology as well as for human readers.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two reasons for choosing to keep the style simple at this point. First of all, it guarantees a content-focused attention free of interruptions, enabling consumers to take in information without needless visual complication. It also establishes the foundation for the next CSS module, which will deal with aesthetics and visual appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
            The JavaScript-based 'Last updated' timestamp was added to provide consumers visibility into how recent the material is. This dynamic feature makes sure that visitors are informed of any current changes or updates and also provides a layer of responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            In later versions of this project, CSS will be included to improve the visual appearance, making the resume visually appealing in addition to being useful. To find the ideal mix between user interaction and professional appearance, ongoing refining will be done.
